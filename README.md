A Global Satellite Fleet Model

Human activity is increasibly reliant on satellite connectivity services for timing, syncronization, positioning etc. 

However, we lack analytics to help understand the vulnerability and resilience of global satellite systems. 

This codebase provides an open-source spatio-temporal model to help analyze the global satellite fleet. Such a model can be used for numerous applications, including risk analysis and digital connectivity assessment.
