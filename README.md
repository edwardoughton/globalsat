Global Satellite Fleet Model

Human activity is increasibly reliant on satellite connectivity services for broadband
internet access, timing, syncronization, positioning etc.

However, we lack analytics to help model global satellite systems, whether we wish to
understand capacity, coverage, cost, vulnerability or resilience.

This codebase provides an open-source model to help analyze the global satellite fleet.
Such a model can be used for numerous applications, including assessment of digital
connectivity or understanding the vulnerability and resilience of the global satellite fleet.


Background and funding
======================

**globalsat** is being collaboratively developed by researchers at George Mason University, as
well as colleagues at the British Antartic Survey and University of Cambridge.
